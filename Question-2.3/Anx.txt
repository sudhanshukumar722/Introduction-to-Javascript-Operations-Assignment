-->> In Javascript, unary, binary, and ternary operators are used to perform operations on one, two, and three operands respectively.

   1.> Unary Operators:-
              Unary operators work on a single operand.
              Example: the unary minus (-) operator changes the sign of its operand. For example, if x is 5, then -x will be -5.
                  int x = 5; 
                  int result = -x; // result will be -5 
                  
   2.> Binary Operators:-
              Binary operators work on two operands.
              Example: In javascript, the addition (+) operator adds two operands. For example, if a is 3 and b is 4, then a + b will result in 7.
                  int a = 3, b = 4; 
                  int result = a + b; // result will be 7 
                  
   3.> Ternary Operators:-  
            The only ternary operator in javascript is the conditional operator (?:), which works on three operands.
            Example: It is used for conditional expressions. For example, consider the expression (x > 5) ? "Greater" : "Lesser", here if x is greater than 5, it will return 
                     "Greater", otherwise "Lesser".
               int x = 6; 
               string result = (x > 5) ? "Greater" : "Lesser"; // result will be "Greater"
