 -->> Declaring variables is one of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript. Variables are used to store and manage data in your programs. To declare a variable means to create 
      a named placeholder for data that you want to use later.

 -->> Just like var in Javascript, let keyword is also used for variable declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped 
     and local variable. A variable declared with let will be out of scope outside the block within which it has been declared.
