-->> Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. When someone, including yourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names 
     make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable.

-->> Well-named variables facilitate code maintenance and debugging.If you or someone else needs to modify or fix a piece of code, having meaningful variable names makes it 
     easier to identify which variables are involved and their purpose.     

-->> When working in a team environment, using clear and consistent variable naming conventions becomes even more critical. It promotes effective collaboration by enabling 
      team members to understand each other's code easily .

-->> Good variable naming practices contribute to code reusability. When you name variables based on their purpose rather than their specific values, it becomes easier to 
     reuse the code in different contexts.
